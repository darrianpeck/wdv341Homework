            let ingredient = {
                name: egg
                amount: 1,
            }

            how do i add an ingredient to the ingredients array? 
                PUT THIS NEW INGREDIENT INTO THE ARRAY:     
                ingredients.push(ingredientName);           ingredeints.push(document.querySelector("#id").value)????

                NEW INGREDIENT OBJECT/NEW VALUES:
                    ingredient.ingredientName = "Flour";
                    ingredientAmount = "1 cup";
                    ingredients.push(ingredient);
            
            LOOP THROUGH TO DISPLAY ALL INGREDIENTS
        }
