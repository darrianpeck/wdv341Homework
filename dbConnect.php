    'The Connection File'
    this file will handle the connection between your program and a database server

    We are going to use PDO (PHP Data Objects) for all database processing

    Note: should be on .gitIgnore list!!!!
        DO NOT upload to your host, make a version specific to your host account

    Opens, and holds open, a doorway between your php processor and the database server
